[{"content":"I started at Playwing in March of 2022 as an intern, which then led to me employed full time until January of 2024. I was a game designer, but as we were a small team, I had many reponsibilities throughout this period. Here are a few features I was given responsibility of.\nMajor Game Mode: Outbreak Outbreak was first featured in The Last Bastion event. It\u0026rsquo;s the first PvE gamemode in Century: Age of Ashes. You play cooperatively in a team of four dragoneers who have to destroy hordes of \u0026ldquo;Dwellers from the shadow\u0026rdquo;, before they break the Valkürian barrier which could lead to the downfall of all civilizations of Skeld.\nEach round, you earn gold that you can spend at the start of the next round to buy upgrades for your dragon. Whether it be stronger attacks, faster shots, lower cooldowns. You\u0026rsquo;ll encounter more enemies as you go, as well as new types of enemies. If you manage to contain the 10 waves of enemies, you win the battle. The game mode is playable in four difficulty settings.\nTrailer Gameplay My role I was given the core design responsibility, which after validation went onto a prototype on which I worked for many weeks. Once the prototype got validated, a team of programmers came along to polish the features as well as rework what needed to be. It was a blast working with more experimented people and exchanging ideas about game systems. I discovered that my propositions weren\u0026rsquo;t so bad and that I was able to communicate and manage a small team. I also worked closely with our UI artist so the user experience would be spotless.\nCharacter: The Rimeblood Each new Century season came with a new character. For this one, we only had four months. I was the main designer for this character and its powers. The concept was a harassing support kind of class, which would buff allies and debuff enemies just as Overwatch\u0026rsquo;s Zenyatta. I worked closely with our gameplay programmer as well as artists to closely design the controls and camera for the powers. It was a meticulous work of coordinating everyone on the team so we could achieve the result we wanted. The first ability called \u0026ldquo;Feral Charge\u0026rdquo; especially needed iteration, as it was the first time in Century there would be a melee attack.\nMajor Game Mode : Artifact I was tasked with coming up with a new game mode concept for the game, that would join the main game mode rotation. The goal was to adapt the classic Search and Destroy gamemode features in games such as Counter Strike or Valorant, but with the gameplay of Century, which is really tricky. In Century, your dragon constantly moves, you cannot hide, you cannot take positions, and you cannot stop. As such, the adaptation was challenging but really fun. It would also be Century\u0026rsquo;s very first asymetric game mode.\nAfter the game concept was done, another team took on the actual implementation.\nMinor game modes As part of a liveops update, I designed a lot of gamemode concepts, from which two were chosen to be developed as part as the Colosseum event : small twists on existing gamemodes that would renew the player\u0026rsquo;s interest in the game and would provide more content for future events.\nKingslayer : In each team, one player is designated as the \u0026ldquo;king\u0026rdquo;. The team earns points by killing the king. If a king is killed, another player in the team becomes king. If the king survives long enough, they make their team earn point and passes the king role to someone else.\nPlunder : A twist on the classic Spoils of War Century game mode. You kill gold carrier dragons and have to bring it back to your team\u0026rsquo;s vault. But this time, gold is limited and players have to ability to steal from the enemy\u0026rsquo;s vault.\nNew abilities As part of a content update, I worked on four new abilities for the (at the time) four characters in game. This would be the first time wharacters could choose between more than two abilities in Century. Those abilities were meant to be sold using soft currency, providing players with progression. The balancing was especially challenging, as the abilities shouldn\u0026rsquo;t give an unfair advantage to players.\n","date":"2024-01-25T01:36:21+01:00","image":"https://clemorl.fr/post/century/banner_hufd7daa78f73a0ea9a2b095306d3c61af_428433_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://clemorl.fr/post/century/","title":"Century Age of Ashes"},{"content":"Divunity is quite the unique experience, and honestly one of the projects I\u0026rsquo;m most proud of. It\u0026rsquo;s a VR god game where two players have to cooperate to make their people live together despite hating each other. The focus is both on the communication/strategy aspect and the inherent pleasure to play with a VR toy.\nShowcase This video introduces the gameplay mechanics, and later shows a playthrough.\nFrom concept to delivery I had the chance to pitch this idea in front of my colleagues, and for it to be selected among the 12 projects we would create.\nIt all started with a clear vision a few colleagues and I had back in 2019. From it came a crude game concept I made to showcase the key concepts. From there, a team of 4 people and I developed a demo in the span of three months, including networking and physics.\nWe then presented this game to the public, and this massive amount of new players brought to light some of the shortcomings of the design and other UX problems. VR is no easy feat! If this would turn into a full game, we\u0026rsquo;d have loads of content and improvements to add. We learned a ton and had a blast making it.\nMy roles on the project :\nGame designer Gameplay programmer Team leader Brought to you by Credit Role Pierre Aceituno Producer Solène Pobelle Character and environment artist Noé Simon UX Designer, User Researcher Pamphile Saltel Programmer The original idea was imagined and playtested by Marie Abrino, Sohel Bourgeau, Hippolyte Follenfant, Morgan Geniez and myself.\nGallery Feature Highlight: The Requests system I designed, prototypes and integrated this game system from start to finish. During the game, your people will ask you new buildings. It was my favorite feature to work on, as it included element of systems design, technical design, level design and narrative design.\nIn the first iteration, requests were rudimentary, they would just show a building type, and an action: build or destroy. It didn\u0026rsquo;t offer much variety and so felt boring. Also, players didn\u0026rsquo;t really understand the goal of the game, and the impact of their action on their people\u0026rsquo;s beliefs.\nThen, we overhauled the system to include a full sentence of what the people asked you to do, with a crafting hint on the back. This allowed for more ambiguity and player choice. For example, if your people say \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re scared of the other people, do something\u0026rdquo;, then you have two options :\nBuild a guard tower in order to make them feel safe Ask your teammate to destroy their guard tower, so your people don\u0026rsquo;t feel threatened. This opened the door to much more diverse requests, and made the stakes of the game really clear to the players.\nRequests are procedurally generated based on the state of the game, like the score of each players or which buildings are in-game. Most of the late-game buildings (when the two tribes like each other more) require you to use resources from your partner, enhancing the cooperation both in the game\u0026rsquo;s narration and in the gameplay.\nThe game concludes by the two players having to build a \u0026ldquo;Wonder\u0026rdquo;, a statue in two parts, each player having to build their own part.\n// Sample code of a request // We built convenience helpers to evaluate the state of the game, for example // IsMilitary : Whether the game is in the military age, aka both people hate each other new Request { text = Loc.GetString(\u0026#34;We hate this other tribe, we don\u0026#39;t want to see them ever again!\u0026#34;), // What building to show on the request requestedBuilding = BuildingHelpers.GetBuilding(\u0026#34;Wall\u0026#34;, true), // Predicate that determines when the request may appear preCond = r =\u0026gt; IsMilitary, // Predicate that determines if the request was fulfilled successCond = r =\u0026gt; BuildingHelpers.GetBuilding(\u0026#34;Wall\u0026#34;, true).JustBuilt(), } The requests system could be expanded with much more requests involving more types of actions, more types of buildings. The current form of the requests leaves to be desired, as the text can be hard to read for some players. We\u0026rsquo;d probably change this form if we could continue working on the game.\nDocuments The game documentation (game design document) is free to read. Although note that it\u0026rsquo;s written in french as we were a fully french team.\n","date":"2021-05-24T19:43:55+01:00","image":"https://clemorl.fr/post/divunity/thumbnail_huccc27de69e3f380447de251eaa0be0a2_882592_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://clemorl.fr/post/divunity/","title":"Divunity"}]
